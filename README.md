This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## EmailJS

EmailJS helps to send emails using client-side technologies only. No server is required â€“ just connect [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com) to one of the supported email services, create an email template, and use our Javascript library to trigger an email.

**SERVICE_ID**: Fetched from the default _Email Server_

**TEMPLATE_ID**: Fetched from the _Email Templates_ page

**PUBLIC_KEY**: Fetched From the _Account_ page
